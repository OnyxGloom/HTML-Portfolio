<h2>My Top 3 Movies At This Time</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Star Wars: Return of the Jedi</h3>

<p>EWOKS! That is all I have to say.<br/>
The only problem with this movie is that they changed Darth Vaders Ghost.</p>

<h3>Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>

<p>Its a nice mix between walking and fighting.<br/>
Plus trees that both walk and fight!</p>

<h3>The Italian Job</h3>

<p>Minis, Aston Martins, and Jaguars. <br/>
Oh! and loads of gold!</p>
